# DataViz_NOLA_congregations_1941-2018

Data Story-Telling project analyzing the geo-locations and per-capita count of Baptist / Catholic congregations in New Orleans
from 1941 to present day. The difficulty was finding data as good as the 1941 CSV file from the WPA during their zoning work after the Great Depression. 
This is where I turned to BeautifulSoup and made my own data tables, performing necessary cleaning operations. 

Overall, we can see that despite the precipitous drop in physical church congregations overtime, there is still a 3X larger Catholic presence in New Orleans. 
This tells us a few insights:
1. Catholicsm perhaps may be more of a cultural identity for New Orleanians, in the sense of heritage, rather than an active religious affiliation. 
2. Or, Catholicism tends to gravitate towards larger conglomerate congregations, where people travel further to join a single unified church (less is more). 
3. Baptist churches, being so frequent amongst the geograpy of New Orleans, indicates a neighborhood-affiliation network that speaks to the community-based religion.
4. It is hard for us to say that relgiion is becoming less of a cultural factor in the city just on church-building-frequency alone.
